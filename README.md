# Caesar-Cipher
A basic Caesar cipher with a hard-coded shift key, made in Java
- The cipher uses character arrays, for loops, and a variant of the standard Caesar cipher equation (En(x) = (xÂ±n) mod 26)
- Running the program will ask the user to enter the text to be encrypted
- When entered, the text will be encrypted and then decrypted again
- Note that the shift key is set to 11 in the code, not asked for by the user
